# Shopping Cart App

This repository contains the static assets for the Merrimore boutique hospitality landing page. The site is now located under the `docs/` directory so that GitHub Pages can publish it automatically using the **main branch / docs folder** configuration.

## Getting started

Open `docs/index.html` directly in your browser or use a simple HTTP server such as `npx serve docs` for local development.

## Deployment

1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
2. In **Pages**, choose the `main` branch and the `/docs` folder.
3. Save the settings â€“ GitHub Pages will serve the contents of `docs/index.html` at `https://<username>.github.io/shopping-cart-app/`.

The assets referenced by the page use relative paths, so they resolve correctly whether the site is served locally or by GitHub Pages.
