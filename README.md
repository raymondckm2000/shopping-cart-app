# üõí Online Shopping Cart (GitHub + Codex Cloud Only)

## 1. Overview
This project is an **Online Shopping Cart** web application designed to run fully on **GitHub + Codex Cloud**.  
No local development is required. All code will be generated, updated, and maintained by **Codex Cloud Agent**.  

- **Frontend**: React + Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB (cloud-based, e.g. MongoDB Atlas)  
- **Storage**: Local `/uploads` folder or cloud storage (e.g. Cloudinary, S3)  
- **Target Users**: Retail customers (frontend) and Admins (backend).  

---

## 2. Project Workflow
1. Update this `README.md` with new requirements (Features, Roadmap, or Agent Notes).  
2. Run **Codex Cloud Agent (Full Access)**.  
3. Agent will:  
   - Read this file  
   - Generate/update code in this repo  
   - Commit and push changes automatically  
4. Deploy to cloud platform (Vercel for frontend, Render/Railway for backend).  

---

## 3. Environment
Environment variables will be stored on **cloud deployment platforms** only.  

Example `.env.example` file (committed to repo for reference):  
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/shopping_cart
JWT_SECRET=secret123
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit `.env` files with real secrets.  
Use **Vercel / Render / Railway / Codex Cloud Project Settings** to configure actual values.  

---

## 4. Project Structure
The structure is managed entirely by **Codex Cloud Agent**.  
Expected layout:  

/client # Frontend (React + Vite)
/server # Backend (Node.js + Express)
/tests # Automated tests

- Your responsibilities:  
  - Generate TypeScript code for both frontend and backend  
  - Create API routes under `/server/routes/`  
  - Create React components under `/client/components/`  
  - Implement JWT authentication for admin routes  
  - Use `multer` for image uploads (saved in `/server/uploads/`)  
  - Write tests in `/tests/` folder  
  - Update this `README.md` when features are added/changed  
- Commit messages must follow **Conventional Commits** (e.g. `feat: add product CRUD API`).  

---

## 8. Roadmap
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel (connected to `client/`)  
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render or Railway (connected to `server/`)  
- [ ] Add Stripe/PayPal payment integration  
- [ ] Add order history for customers
